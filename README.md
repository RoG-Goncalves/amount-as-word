# writeOut

A simple Script for writing out any given value in Brazilian Reais (for now, it can write out up to R$ 999.999.999.999,99. Sorry Bezos, you won't be able to use it);

# for testing:
Just run the 'index.html' with Live Server and you will be prompted to write some value in BRL - It sould be in format: /^((\d{1,3})(\.\d{3})*)(\,\d{2})?$/
You'll get the value in the screen.
